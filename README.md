# Welcome to my sorting and searching algorithms

## What is this?

This is where I practice all of my sorting and searching algorithms. Currently everything is done on the console, but eventually I will create a visual representation so it is more of a 'project' I can show. First, however, it's best to show I am working on learning these types of algorithms and see their importance.

## Goals for the project

A short list of straightforward goals:
* Implement basic sorting algorithms
* Implement basic searching algorithms
* Create a visual web application to run them
* Continue implementing more algorithms as I learn!
